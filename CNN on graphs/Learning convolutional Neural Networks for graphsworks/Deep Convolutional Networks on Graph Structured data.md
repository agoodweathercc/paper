Deep Convolutional Networks on Graph Structured data

local stationarity

multi-scale compositional structure

for grid, stationarity is well defined via the natural translation operator on the grid, locality is defined via the metric of the grid, and compositionality is obtained from downsampling, or equivalently thanks ot the multi-resolution property of the grid.

**Motivation**

text document can be seen as bags of words that can be thought as signal on the graph

a extension of 2013 paper. from simple low-dim graph to high-dim general datasets, and most importantly, to the setting where the graph structure is not known a priori.

one can view convolutions as the family of linear transforms commuting with the Laplacian
